- 👋 Hi, I’m @ernieveloper and I'm a systems administrator with an equivalent to a CS degree. 
- 👀 I'm interested in reexploring the world of programming and software development. And I am particularly interested in data engineering and maybe front/back-end developmen.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any project that has a considerable depth of data manipulation.
- 📫 How to reach me ... I will update this part later.
