- 👋 Hi, I’m @ernieveloper
- 👀 I’m interested in regaining my programmming skills, as I have not used them for a long time, as I graduated with an equivalent to a CS degree and went to do Marketing and then Systems Administration instead.I am particularly interested in data engineering; and idk...maybe I will take a different road and even learn front end developement, who knows. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Python and refreshing my SQL skills. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any project that has a considerable depth of data manipulation.
- 📫 How to reach me ...
